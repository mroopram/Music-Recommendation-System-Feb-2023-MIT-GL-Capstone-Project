### Capstone Project - Recommendation Systems Feb 2023

In this project we examine the results of testing various recommendation models for a music streaming service. Techniques explored include Cluster Based, Content Based, Matrix Factorization, Popularity-Based, and Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendation Systems. For each model the K Nearest Neighbor algorithm was used to find similar songs and we used RMSE, Precision, and Recall to test how well the models were able to predict songs a user would play most often.
